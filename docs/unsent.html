<p>
  When you send a message, Postbox&nbsp;sends it in the background by placing it
  in the Unsent/Outbox folder before sending it out. This allows Postbox to close
  the compose window immediately. However, some servers do not work well with this
  setting, causing messages to be stuck in the Outbox. There are a few things you
  can do to fix this issue.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Turn Off Send in Background</strong>
</p>
<p>
  By default, Postbox is set to send in the background, but if you have problems
  with messages getting stuck in the Outbox, this setting should be turned off.
</p>
<p>
  Navigate to&nbsp;<em>Preferences or Options &gt;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Composition &gt; Advanced,&nbsp;</em>then
  turn OFF "Send in background."
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Delete Messages from the Outbox&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If a message is already stuck in the Outbox, navigate to your
  <em>On My Mac</em> or <em>Local Folders</em> account &gt; <em>Outbox</em> and
  delete any messages that are not needed.
</p>
<p>Then restart Postbox.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Repair the Outbox Folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Navigate to your <em>On My Mac</em> or <em>Local Folders</em> account &gt;
  <em>Outbox</em>, right-click the <em>Outbox</em> folder and select "Properties"
  from the contextual menu. Then click the "Repair Folder." button.
</p>
<p>Restart Postbox.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Compact the Outbox Folder</strong>
</p>
<p>Navigate to the File menu and select "Compact."</p>
<p>Wait 3 minutes, then restart Postbox.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Make Sure You Have the Correct Sent Folder Mappings</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
	Navigate to
	<em>Preferences or Options &gt;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Accounts &gt; [your account] &gt; Copies &amp; Folders</em>
  </li>
  <li>
	For the Sent folder, select <em>Other</em>.
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the Sent folder in that account and select it.</li>
  <li>Restart Postbox.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Verify Your SMTP Settings</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Verify that your SMTP settings are correct in
  <em>Preferences or Options &gt;&nbsp;Accounts &gt; Outgoing Server.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sending a Large Message</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you are sending a large message, it's possible that the message is just taking
  a long time to send. In that case, ignore the notification and allow the send&nbsp;action
  to finish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Make sure your signature does not contain images that reside behind a firewall or VPN.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you've attached an image to your signature, like a company logo, ensure it
  is not behind a firewall or VPN and that the link to this image can be publicly
  accessible. Try loading the image at home when not connected to a VPN.&nbsp;
