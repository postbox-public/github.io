<p>The "Default" option will automatically switch between the original "Light" and "Dark" themes based upon the OS preference or dark mode state.</p>
<p><strong>Clips</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.postbox-inc.com/features/clips-library#entry:2596:url">Clips</a> let you quickly insert pre-formatted blocks of HTML into your messages. It works similarly to Responses and Signatures, but Clips have two additional capabilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clips can insert CSS into the &lt;head&gt; region of a message</li>
  <li>A default Clip can be used per identity when new messages are composed</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that you can now create sophisticated newsletters, brand templates, or stationary and use them as needed or by default per identity.</p>
<p>Theoretically, any email template that you can create or find on the web can now be used in Postbox.</p>
<p>Like Signatures and Responses, we've included a suite of example Clips that you can use in your messages, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>checked bullets</li>
  <li>numbered bullets</li>
  <li>buttons</li>
  <li>callouts</li>
  <li>description list</li>
  <li>horizontal rules</li>
  <li>image blocks</li>
  <li>quotes</li>
  <li>social follow blocks</li>
  <li>text blocks</li>
  <li>tables</li>
</ul>
<p>To access Custom Clips, open the Compose window, make sure the Clips button is added to the Toolbar, press and hold the Clips button, then select Custom Clips from the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong></p>
<p>Similar to add-ons, our <a href="https://www.postbox-inc.com/product/labs#entry:2533:url">Labs</a> feature will allow for experimental 3rd-party code to be used within Postbox.</p>
<p>The first Labs project will be OpenPGP support provided by a specially designed version of Enigmail for Postbox and can be
  enabled under the Tools menu (remember to add the appropriate buttons to the Compose window toolbar).</p>
<p>Unlike add-ons which can be arbitrarily installed, only a select number of Labs projects will be available for Postbox. Given that Labs projects contain 3rd-party experimental code, they are not officially supported by Postbox, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud File Sharing for Business</strong></p>
<p>By popular demand, we've added two new services to our Cloud File Sharing feature:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dropbox for Business</li>
  <li>OneDrive for Business</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Swipe Gestures on macOS</strong></p>
<p>We've created a new swipe mechanism on macOS that will provide better feedback for four commonly used actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 swipe left = Archive</li>
  <li>full swipe left = Reminder</li>
  <li>1/2 swipe right = Junk</li>
  <li>full swipe right = Delete</li>
</ul>
<p>The swipe actions work on a "swipe-n-hold" basis. Swipe until the desired action is displayed, hold, then let go once the swipe action "activates." This usage pattern was designed to prevent accidental swipes from performing an action.</p>
<p>Most importantly, swipe actions can be performed on multiple messages at once!</p>
<p>Currently, this feature is available on macOS only.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Copy</strong></p>
<p>This works similarly to Quick Move but copies the message to the desired folder instead of moving it. The keyboard shortcut "c" will bring up the Quick Bar, and from there you can type the name of the folder you wish to copy the message to.</p>
<p><strong>Gmail Labeling Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>We've created a new mechanism for Gmail labeling that mirrors the actions used for Quick Move, Quick Switch, and Quick Copy. Type the "l" key to bring up the Quick Bar, then autocomplete against the desired label name.</p>
<p>Gmail labeling works similarly to Topic assignment in the Quick Bar, and you can now assign multiple labels at once.</p>
<p><strong>Highlight & Strikethrough in Compose</strong></p>
<p>The compose formatting toolbar now supports text strikethrough and highlighting.</p>
<p><strong>New Filter Actions</strong></p>
<p>We've added three more filter actions:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
